# PLanguages
Exercises from Programming Languages course. Instructor: Dan Grossman.

Part A focus on the functional programming language SML.

- [Week 1](https://github.com/JaumLA/PLanguages/tree/main/Part%20A/Week%201) themes: type check, semantics, binding, lists, pairs and tuples, let and options.
- [Week 2](https://github.com/JaumLA/PLanguages/tree/main/Part%20A/Week%202) themes: creating data types, type synonyms, type inference, pattern-matching, nested patterns, exceptions and tail recursive.
- [Week 3](https://github.com/JaumLA/PLanguages/tree/main/Part%20A/Week%203) themes: higher-order and first class functions, closure and environments, anonymous functions, important functions (fold, filter and map) and callback functions.
- **Week 4** has just a final exam with the additional themes: mutual recursion, modules and signatures, hiding implementation, equivalent implementations and side-effect-free programming.

Part B focus on the functional programming language Racket.
- [Week 5](https://github.com/JaumLA/PLanguages/tree/main/Part%20B/Week%205) themes: semantics, types, local bindings (let, let* and letrec), delayed evaluation and thunks, streams and memoization.
- [Week 6](https://github.com/JaumLA/PLanguages/tree/main/Part%20B/Week%206) themes: recursive Datatypes, implementating a programming language, macros and implementing closures.
- **Week 7** has just a final exam with the additional themes: static checking, correctness (soundness, completeness and undeciadability) and weak typing.

Part C focus on the object-oriented programming language Ruby.
- [Week 8](https://github.com/JaumLA/PLanguages/tree/main/Part%20C/Week%207) themes: OOP, semantics, types, getters/setters, duck typing, blocks, hashes and ranges.
- [Week 9](https://github.com/JaumLA/PLanguages/tree/main/Part%20C/Week%208) themes: OOP decomposition,double dispatch, multiple inheritance, mixins and binary methods.
- **Week 10** has just a final exam with the additional themes: subtyping, generics and bounded polymorphism.
